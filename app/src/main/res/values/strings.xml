    <string name="sphere_definition">Sphere (SPH) indicates the amount of lens power, measured in diopters (D), prescribed to correct your nearsightedness or farsightedness. \n\nIf the value has a minus sign (-), you are nearsighted; if the number has a plus sign (+) or is not preceded by a plus sign or a minus sign, you are farsighted.</string>
    <string name="cylinder_definition">Cylinder (CYL) indicates you have a condition where the cornea and/or lens of the eye are irregularly shaped causing blurred vision, in other words, astigmatism. \n\nIt is measured in diopters (D), mostly having a value between 0.00 to +/- 20.00, and go up in steps of 0.25.</string>
    <string name="axis_definition">Axis indicates the degree of the angle at which the cylinder is placed on your corrective lenses and can be anywhere between 0 and 180 degrees.</string>
    <string name="add_definition">Add refers to the additional correction you may need to focus at short distances and is more common over the age of 40. </string>
    <string name="disclaimer">This only calculates the spherical component of the Rx. It does not change the cylinder, axis or prism components - values from the original Rx would be included for these components along with the calculated sphere power.</string>
